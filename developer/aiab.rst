Aether In a Box - 4G
====================

Aether in a Box (AiaB) has been deprecated and replaced by `Aether OnRamp <https://docs.aetherproject.org/onramp/overview.html>`_.

Aether OnRamp is the recommended way to deploy and test SD-Core. For 4G deployments,
OnRamp provides support through the **Physical eNBs blueprint**, which supports
4G-based versions of both SD-Core and AMP.

For detailed information about deploying 4G with physical eNBs, see the
`Physical eNBs Blueprint <https://docs.aetherproject.org/onramp/blueprints.html#physical-enbs>`_
in the Aether OnRamp documentation.
