Aether In a Box - 5G
====================

Previously developers used Aether in a Box (AiaB) environment to test SD-Core. But AiaB is
now deprecated and Aether OnRamp is suggested way for developers to install Aether.

The documentation for deploying SD-Core (Private 5G) solution on a Kubernetes cluster is
located in `Aether OnRamp <https://docs.aetherproject.org/master/onramp/overview.html>`_,
where specifics about setting up Aether 5G, running 5G test, troubleshooting, and other details are described.
