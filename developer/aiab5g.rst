Aether In a Box - 5G
====================

Aether in a Box (AiaB) has been deprecated and replaced by `Aether OnRamp <https://docs.aetherproject.org/onramp/overview.html>`_.

Aether OnRamp is the recommended way to deploy and test SD-Core. It provides an incremental
path for users to learn about, customize, experiment with, and deploy Aether with live 5G traffic.

OnRamp supports multiple deployment scenarios through various **blueprints**, including:

* Quick Start deployment (single VM or server)
* Emulated RAN using gNBsim
* Physical RAN with real gNBs
* Multiple UPFs configuration
* UERANSIM for throughput testing
* SD-RAN integration
* OAI and srsRAN 5G support

For comprehensive documentation on deploying SD-Core (Private 5G) on a Kubernetes cluster,
including setup, testing, troubleshooting, and operational details, visit the
`Aether OnRamp Documentation <https://docs.aetherproject.org/onramp/overview.html>`_.
